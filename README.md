# In-Game Hero Switch

## NOTE: This alpha version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0, see [here](https://github.com/doombubbles/BTD6-Mods#readme) for the stable mods

Ever forget to switch your hero before starting up a game?
Now you don't have to exit and and come back.
Just press the **PageUp** and **PageDown** keys to cycle through your unlocked heroes.
This will work at any point in a match, so long as your hero isn't already placed down.
